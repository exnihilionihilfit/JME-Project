JME-Project

This is only a test case yet. You could create a server and connect with a client. Then you be able to create an ship and move it around. 

In the next version it will be a gui login 
now you need your console

To start a server:

* go into ServerMutliThread/dist/
* you need only to Server.jar and lib folder
* via console go into dist folder and run Server.jar (java -jar Server.jar)
(it could be that you need to add java to your buildpath)

To start a client

* download Client-Test.zip
* unpack
* via console go into Client-Test folder and run Client.jar (java -jar Client.jar)
